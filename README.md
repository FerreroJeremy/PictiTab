# PictiTab version 4.0 ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FerreroJeremy/PictiTab/master/res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png)

PictiTab is a communication tool for children with communication disorders. <br/>
[A beta version (version 2.5 only for tablets) is freely available on the Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pictitab.app) (last update on March 29, 2014).

## Origin

[PictiTab](http://talep.lif.univ-mrs.fr/PictiTab/) is a French project that is the result of a collaboration between:
* the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale](http://www.lif.univ-mrs.fr/) of Marseille
* the [Laboratoire sur le Langage, le Cerveau et la Cognition](http://l2c2.isc.cnrs.fr/drupal7/index.html) of Bron
* and the [Saint-Jean de Dieu](http://sjd.arhm.fr/) Lyon's hospital 

The software was designed initially for iPad. <br/>
Then for a Master's degree project, a team of friends and I realized an Android version. <br/>

## Important

Please excuse the OOP implementation and the English comments. <s>I am taking over the project.</s> <b>I stop the development of the project for a while to focus on my professional work.</b> But any help that you can give is welcome.
