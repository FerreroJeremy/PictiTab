## Origin

[PictiTab](http://talep.lif.univ-mrs.fr/PictiTab/) is a <b>French project</b> that is the result of a collaboration between:
* the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale](http://www.lif.univ-mrs.fr/) of Marseille
* the [Laboratoire sur le Langage, le Cerveau et la Cognition](http://l2c2.isc.cnrs.fr/drupal7/index.html) of Bron
* and the [Saint-Jean de Dieu](http://sjd.arhm.fr/) Lyon's hospital 

The software was designed initially for iPad. <br/>
Then for a Master's degree project, a team of friends and I realized an <b>Android</b> version. <br/>

## Support

I apologise for the draft OOP implementation and the poor English translation. I stop the development of the project for a while to focus on my professional work. So, any help is welcome!
